    <h1>Top Designers</h1>
    <h2>Virgil Abloh</h2>
    <p>Virgil Abloh (September 30, 1980 to November 28, 2021) was 
        an American fashion designer and entrepreneur. One of the most influential 
        and respected fashion designers of his generation, he began his own line 
        of luxury streetwear clothing, Pyrex Vision, in 2012, and became the chief 
        executive officer of the Milan-based label Off-White, a fashion house he 
        founded in 2013. Abloh was also the artistic director of Louis Vuitton's 
        menswear collection beginning in 2018, and was given increased creative 
        responsibilities across the LVMH brand in early 2021.

    <h2>Rick Owens</h2>
    <p> Richard Saturnino Owens was raised in Porterville, California. His parents 
        are John (d. 2015) and Concepción "Connie" Owens. His mother is Mexican. 
        Owens was raised in a conservative, Catholic household. After graduating 
        high school, he moved to Los Angeles, California to study art at Otis College 
        of Art and Design for two years before taking pattern-making and draping courses 
        at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College. This led to work in the garment industry, 
        designing copies of designer clothing. Owens then met Michèle Lamy, who at this 
        time was well-known in the Los Angeles social scene and owned the "Lamy" sportswear 
        brand.</p>

        <h2>Christian Dior</h2>
        <p>Christian Ernest Dior 21 January 1905 to 24 October 1957) was a French fashion designer, 
            best known as the founder of one of the world's top fashion houses, Christian Dior SE, 
            which is now owned by parent company LVMH. His fashion houses are known all around the 
            world, having gained prominence "on five continents in only a decade."
            Dior's skills led to his employment and design for various fashion icons in attempts to 
            preserve the fashion industry during World War II. Post-war, he founded and established 
            the Dior fashion house, with his collection of the "New Look".
            Throughout his lifetime, he won numerous awards for Best Costume Design. Upon his death 
            in 1957, various contemporary icons paid tribute to his life and work.</p>
