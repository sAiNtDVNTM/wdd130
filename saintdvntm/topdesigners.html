          <p>Designer</p>
          <p>Virgil Abloh (September 30, 1980 to November 28, 2021) was <br>
            an American fashion designer and entrepreneur. One of the most influential<br> 
            and respected fashion designers of his generation, he began his own line <br>
            of luxury streetwear clothing, Pyrex Vision, in 2012, and became the chief <br>
            executive officer of the Milan-based label Off-White, a fashion house he <br>
            founded in 2013. Abloh was also the artistic director of Louis Vuitton's <br>
            menswear collection beginning in 2018, and was given increased creative <br>
            responsibilities across the LVMH brand in early 2021.</p>

          <h4><b>Christian Dior</b></h4>
          <p>Designer</p>
          <p>Christian Ernest Dior 21 January 1905 to 24 October 1957) was a French fashion designer,<br> 
            best known as the founder of one of the world's top fashion houses, Christian Dior SE, <br>
            which is now owned by parent company LVMH. His fashion houses are known all around the <br>
            world, having gained prominence "on five continents in only a decade."<br>
            Dior's skills led to his employment and design for various fashion icons in attempts to <br>
            preserve the fashion industry during World War II. Post-war, he founded and established <br>
            the Dior fashion house, with his collection of the "New Look".<br>
            Throughout his lifetime, he won numerous awards for Best Costume Design. Upon his death<br> 
            in 1957, various contemporary icons paid tribute to his life and work.</p>

          <h4><b>Rick Owens</b></h4>
          <p>Designer</p>
          <p>Richard Saturnino Owens was raised in Porterville, California. His parents <br>
            are John (d. 2015) and Concepción "Connie" Owens. His mother is Mexican. <br>
            Owens was raised in a conservative, Catholic household. After graduating <br>
            high school, he moved to Los Angeles, California to study art at Otis College <br> 
            of Art and Design for two years before taking pattern-making and draping courses <br>
            at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College. This led to work in the garment industry, <br>
            designing copies of designer clothing. Owens then met Michèle Lamy, who at this <br>
            time was well-known in the Los Angeles social scene and owned the "Lamy" sportswear <br>
            brand.</p>
