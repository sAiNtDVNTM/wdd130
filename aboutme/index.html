        Hello Team!! let me introduce myself, I have 23 years old I'm an only child I don't have brothers, single, and without children. I'm from Guatemala right now I'm living in a small village 
        called Boca Del Monte I love playing soccer with my friends every Saturday, I really love doing sports! I love music and also I"m a new programmer. I started this career thanks to BYU Phatway,
        BYU give me the opportunity to start this wonderful career and also I really love logic, I discover this thanks to the mission because I was serving during covid-19 so I was stuck at home. 
        Before all this happen I bought a Rubik's Cube 3x3 so I didn't have any technology only my scriptures and my cube so all my days during covid I was reading my scriptures all day and then trying
        to solve the cube, I started with a few instructions and now for more than 2 years I can solve the 3x3 Rubik's cube in no more than 20 seconds with a lot of methods and algorithms so this is why 
        I love logic and I feel like programming and doing Web pages is similar to this I know maybe is something crazy but thanks to that experience I have a new desire in my life to become a programmer 
        and web developer. I really don't have too much experience but I'm willing to work with all my strength to achieve this wonderful goal. by the way I served in Peru Iquitos! I'm really grateful to 
        my heavenly father for giving me this wonderful opportunity to study at BYU I'm very grateful because I feel that the heavenly father is guiding me since I was born, I really can feel the heavenly 
        father's love in all my life! right now I feel a bunch of emotions like excitement and fear but I know that I'm not alone I have help from my heavenly father and the help of all of you, we are a Team. 
        Right now I'm working in a call center area but one of my biggest goals is to work doing what I love Web development and programming!
